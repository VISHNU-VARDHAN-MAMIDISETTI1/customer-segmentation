## Introduction  
Customer segmentation is a key strategy in modern business analytics. By grouping customers into clusters with similar traits, businesses can optimize marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall sales.  

This project uses the K-Means algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning technique for clustering data points into predefined groups based on their similarities.  

## Features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding customer data.  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.  
- Implementation of K-Means clustering.  
- Visualization of customer clusters using 2D and 3D plots.  
- Elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  

## Results  
The project successfully identifies meaningful customer segments based on input features. Key insights derived from the clusters are visualized, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.  

## Installation
